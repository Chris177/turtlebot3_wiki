WORLD’S MOST POPULAR ROS PLATFORM
---------------------------------
TurtleBot is the world’s most popular open source robot for education and research. The new generation 'TurtleBot3' is a small, low cost, fully programmable, ROS based mobile robot. It is intended to be used for the purpose of education, research, product prototyping, and hobby application.

LOW COST
--------
TurtleBot was built for the cost-conscious needs from the educations and the proto-type research & developments. TurtleBot3 is the most affordable robot among the SLAM-capable mobile robots equipped with the 360-degree Lidar that are sold on the market.

SMALL SIZE
----------
The size of the TurtleBot basic model is 140mm x 140mm x 150mm (L x W x H). This size is about 1/4 of that of TurtleBot 1, 2. You just imagine that you can now just put your TurtleBot in your backpack.

BUILT FOR ROS
-------------
The TurtleBot brand is managed by `Open Source Robotics Foundation, Inc. (OSRF)`_, which develops and manages ROS. Since then, ROS has quickly become the go-to software platform for roboticists around the world. Not only will the TurtleBot seamlessly integrate with your existing ROS-driven robots, it also offers an affordable platform to get started learning with ROS.

EXTENSIBILITY FOR CUSTOMIZING
-----------------------------
We will offer extensibility for customizing on the mechanical structure with some alternative options: open-source embedded board, the computer, and the sensors. The basic model of Turtlebot3 is Two-wheeled differential drive type, but we will provide various examples of mechanical customization. Let you make many shapes of robots with any ideas that you can imagine.

MODULAR ACTUATOR FOR MOBILE ROBOT
---------------------------------
TurtleBot3 uses the 2 Dynamixels as wheel joints. Dynamixel X series supports 6 operating modes, like velocity control mode for wheels, torque and position control mode for joint. We want to tell you this with special emphasis, since if you want to make a mobile manipulator, it is very suitable solution for using velocity, torque and position control.

POWERFULL SENSORS
-----------------
The TurtleBot3 Basic model uses a 360° Lidar. The TurtleBot3 premium model is equipped with a 360° Lidar as well as a powerful Intel RealSense with recognition SDK. This will be the best solution for your mobile robot.

OPEN SOURCE
-----------
We will provide open-source H/W, F/W, and S/W. Basically, we will provide TurtleBot's parts as injection molded plates for low-cost. But we also have a plan to provide CAD data for 3D printing. We release the data in Onshape, it’s a full-cloud 3D CAD system. You can access by using web browser, or phones. Here you can do your work like drawing, or assemblying the part, Working with your co-workers together. You can change your Turtlebot3 design as you want. Also, we will provide everything of OpenCR board including Schematics, PCB Gerber, BOM / firmware for turtlebot3 with open-source licenses for you and ROS community.
