Turtlebot3
----------

TurtleBot3 is a small, low足cost, fully programmable, ROS足 based mobile robot. It is intended for use in education, research, product prototyping, and hobby applications.

Our goal with TurtleBot3 is to dramatically reduce the size and cost of the platform without sacrificing capability, functionality, or quality. Furthermore, we aim for TurtleBot 3 to offer more options for customization in the mechanical structure, the computer, and the sensor(s). These goals are achievable today because of significant recent advances in single足board computers, depth sensors, and rapid prototyping (e.g., 3足D printing).

Hardware
--------

The components of Turtlebot3 in default version is as follows: Chassis, Motors, Wheels, OpenCR board, Computer, Sensor, Battery. The chassis is composed in several kind of parts like plates, board support, ball caster. Main feature of the chassis are small size, For example, the Octa-plate,which is the biggest of the basic parts, is smaller than your hand. We will provide this parts as injection molded plates for low-cost. But we also have a plan to provide CAD data for 3D printing. The basic model of Turtlebot3 is Two-wheeled differential drive type, but we will provide various examples of mechanical customization.

We release the data in Onshape, it is a full-cloud 3D CAD system. You can access by using web browser, or phones. Here you can do your work like drawing, or assemblying the part, working with your co-workers together.

- Turtlebot3 premium model: (comming soon)

Software
--------

We will provide full open-source software. The main license is Apache 2.0 license. The full source release we are looking at would be first quarter of 2017.
